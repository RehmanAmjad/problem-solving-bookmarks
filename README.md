This is an **incomplete** list of resources I would recommend for GCSE / A-level students wanting to improve their problem solving skills. Feel free to bookmark this page with the date and come back to it regularly to see any changes. Whilst you're here, I also recommend reading my tips for problem solving [here](https://github.com/RehmanAmjad/tips-on-problem-solving/blob/master/README.md).


# Maths / Physics

## Websites
- [Expii Solve](https://v1.expii.com/solve) has an interesting collection mathematical puzzles that link nicely to everyday life.
- [Isaac Physics](https://isaacphysics.org/) has some really fun physics questions.
- [Brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org) is quite popular and has some really fun problems on their community and practice pages. You don't need to buy their premium subscription to use them, only for the course. I found these free pages to be better than buying the subscription.
- [Nigel Coldwell's Riddles](http://puzzles.nigelcoldwell.co.uk/) has some really fun problems of varying difficulty and useful hints.
- [AoPS Collection](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c13_contests) has problems ranging from local math competitions to the IMO.
- [Cut The Knot](https://www.cut-the-knot.org/)
- [Maths Challenge](https://mathschallenge.net/)

## Challenges / Olympiads
- [Senior UKMT Challenge Questions](https://colmanweb.co.uk/problemsolving/ukmt.html) is doable for Year 11 students. You can enter the competition in Sixth Form or even earlier (by asking your teachers). If you start to find these problems too easy, have a look at the [BMO1 Papers](https://bmos.ukmt.org.uk/home/bmo.shtml#bmo1).
- [Intermediate Physics Challenge](https://www.bpho.org.uk/past-papers/physics-challenge-gcse)

## YouTube Channels
- [MindYourDecisions](https://www.youtube.com/user/MindYourDecisions/videos)

# Computer Science

## Websites
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) has an excellent sent of problems you can practice your programming skills on.

## YouTube Channels
- [Freecodecamp](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp/videos) has some great introductory videos for programming languages.
