This is an **incomplete** set of lists that I am creating for GCSE and A-level students who wish to improve their problem solving skills. Feel free to bookmark this page (with today's date to compare to last updated) and come back to it regularly to see any changes.

Whilst you are here, I would recommend reading my tips for problem solving which you can find [here](https://github.com/RehmanAmjad/tips-on-problem-solving/blob/master/README.md).

If you would like to make any suggestions then feel free to send me a message on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/theramjad/) or make an issue here on GitHub.

# GCSE

You can find my GCSE recommendations [here](https://github.com/RehmanAmjad/problem-solving-bookmarks/blob/master/GCSE.md).
