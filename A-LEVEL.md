This is an **incomplete** list of resources (in no particular order) that I would recommend for A-level students wanting to improve their problem solving skills for admissions tests, end of year exams, and university.

# Maths / Physics

## Books
_I have included the Google Books link for each. You can find them on Amazon or eBay and buy them yourself._

- [Thinking Physics](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Q9ZINwAACAAJ) had a really good collection of short physics-related problems. It's probably the most accessible book of this list.
- [Professor Povey's Perplexing Problems](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Jmh-zQEACAAJ) is a book I bought in early Year 12 and used it a lot throughout the two years. It has a great set of problems of varying difficulty across physics with some neat solutions too.
- [The Chicken from Minsk](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=X99AAQAAIAAJ) is a collection of maths and physics brain twisters of varying difficultly that I really enjoyed doing.
- [Brainteaser Physics](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Brainteaser_Physics.html?id=rLAI-0GVnD8C) is an awesome book that got me thinking about some fun and imaginative problems. I only did a few questions from here because some are really quite solid!


## Websites
- [Expii Solve](https://v1.expii.com/solve) has an interesting collection mathematical puzzles that link nicely to everyday life.
- [Isaac Physics](https://isaacphysics.org/) has some really fun physics questions and is closely tied to the content of the GCSE & A-level curriculum.
- [Brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org) is quite popular and has some really fun and interesting problems on their community and practice pages. You don't need to buy their premium subscription to use those pages, buying premium is only for the courses. I found these free pages much more useful than buying the subscription.
- [Nigel Coldwell's Riddles](http://puzzles.nigelcoldwell.co.uk/) has some really fun problems of varying difficulty and useful hints.
- [AoPS Contest Collection](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c13_contests) has problems ranging from local math competitions to the IMO.
- [Cut The Knot](https://www.cut-the-knot.org/) has some fun maths problems with nice Java applets to improve your understanding.
- [Maths Challenge](https://mathschallenge.net/archive) has an awesome collection of problems of varying difficulty which you can find as 4 big PDF's.

## Challenges / Olympiads
- [Senior UKMT Challenge Questions](https://colmanweb.co.uk/problemsolving/ukmt.html) has many many great and hard maths problems that don't require anything beyond Year 11 Maths. You can enter the competition in Sixth Form or even earlier (by asking your teachers). If you start to find these problems too easy, have a look at the [BMO1 Papers](https://bmos.ukmt.org.uk/home/bmo.shtml#bmo1).
- [Intermediate Physics Challenge](https://www.bpho.org.uk/past-papers/physics-challenge-gcse) can serve as good practice for developing more physics-based problem-solving. But as you learn more A-level content then you should be more able to do the [AS Physics Challenge](https://www.bpho.org.uk/past-papers/as-challenge), [A2 Physics Challenge](https://www.bpho.org.uk/past-papers/a2-challenge) or even the [British Physics Olympiad](https://www.bpho.org.uk/past-papers/round-1).

# Computer Science

## Websites
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) has an excellent sent of problems you can practice your programming skills on.
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is a competitive programming web that I quite enjoy with good discussions on many problems. You can find some tutorials such as the "30 Days of Code" for beginners.

## YouTube Channels
- [Freecodecamp](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp/videos) has some great introductory videos for programming languages.
- [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/thecodingtrain/) has some really fun creative coding tutorials and challenges. You navigate his video library more easily using his [website](https://thecodingtrain.com/).
